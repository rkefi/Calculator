Defect Title : Minus Sign (-) not displayed in front of the result

Steps to reproduce :

Given I navigate to the Calculator  page
    And The Calculator main page is displayed
    When I enter a multiple digit number 2
    And I choose an arithmetic operation "DIV"
    And I choose an arithmetic operation "MINUS"
    And I enter a multiple digit number 3
    Then The output display is updated with the result of the evaluation of my expression -0.6666666666


Actual Results :

The expression is evaluated but the result displayed is 0.66666666.
When i've inspected the element using the Chrome Developer Tools i found that the web element has the correct value (-0.666666666) which means it's probably a User Interface Issue.
